Boost the way people interact with your site with an easy WordPress stars rating system! With schema.org rich snippets YASR will improve your SEO

== Description ==
Improving the user experience with your website is a top priority for everyone who cares about their online activity,
as it promotes familiarity and loyalty with your brand, and enhances visibility of your activity.

Yasr - Yet Another Stars Rating is a powerful way to add SEO-friendly user-generated reviews and testimonials to your
website posts, pages and CPT, without affecting its speed.

== How To use ==

== Reviewer Vote ==
With the classic editor, when you create or update a page or a post, a box (metabox) will be available in the upper right corner where you'll
be able to insert the overall rating.
With the new Guteneberg editor, just click on the "+" icon to add a block and search for Yasr Overall Rating.
You can either place the overall rating automatically at the beginning or the end of a post (look in "Settings"
-> "Yet Another Stars Rating: Settings"), or wherever you want in the page using the shortcode [yasr_overall_rating] (easily added through the visual editor).

== Visitor Votes ==
You can give your users the ability to vote, pasting the shortcode [yasr_visitor_votes] where you want the stars to appear.
If you're using the new Gutenberg editor, just click on the "+" icon to add a block and search for Yasr Visitor Votes
Again, this can be placed automatically at the beginning or the end of each post; the option is in "Settings" -> "Yet Another Stars Rating: Settings".

== Multi Set ==
Multisets give the opportunity to score different aspects for each review: for example, if you're reviewing a videogame, you can create the aspects "Graphics", "Gameplay", "Story", etc.

== Migration tools ==
You can easily migrate from *WP-PostRatings*, *kk Star Ratings*, *Rate My Post* and *Multi Rating*
A tab will appear in the settings if one of these plugin is detected.
